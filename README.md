## Getting Started

To compile and run Scuttlebutt on your machine, simply use these commands:

```bash
make
./scuttlebutt
```

The `Makefile` is configured for Clang++, so be sure have it installed on your system.

>❗ Please note, it seems you cannot compile the project with gcc/g++, as per [this issue](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55971). I welcome any proprosed fixes.

## Background

This project began as an assignment for CIS 343: Structure of Programming Languages* at Grand Valley State University, led by [@irawoodring](https://github.com/irawoodring) in Winter 2021. The goal was to create a clone of a certain popular board game that was designed with strong adherence to object-oriented programming principles. I hope my class structure and usage accurately reflects that. Since then, I’ve been tinkering and toying away at this project until I figured it was ready to share online.

_*I ask that you please do not copy any of the code present in this project for school assignments without proper citation, or else I’m sure your instructor will find out! I recommend you use this as an educational guide as to how you might approach your own project!_

## Why "Scuttlebutt"?

In hopes of not infringing on any protected intellectual properties, I clicked on the first Google search result for a list of naval terms. Scuttlebutt just made me giggle.
